## Project Scope

### Web Scraping
Develop a web scraping tool that can extract the required data from Skechers and Bantu Store websites.
The tool will be designed to scrape the websites on a fortnightly basis.
The extracted data will be stored in a CSV file:
  * Product Information -
Scraping the competitor's web store can provide valuable information about their products. This includes details such as product descriptions, features, prices, availability, and customer reviews. This information can help you understand the types of products your competitors are offering, how they are pricing them, and how they are positioning them in the market.
* Promotions and Discounts -
Monitoring your competitors' web stores can provide insights into their promotional strategies. You can track the types of discounts, promotions, and sales they are running and how frequently they are offered. This can help you identify potential opportunities to differentiate your offerings and promotions.
* Customer Engagement -
Scrapping competitor's web stores can help you understand how they are engaging with their customers. You can monitor their customer reviews, feedback, and complaints to identify any areas where they may be falling short or any opportunities to improve your own customer engagement.


### Data Cleaning and Processing
The scraped data will be cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Any missing data will be handled by filling it with 'NA' or 'Not Available' during the cleaning process.

### Quality Assurance
The solution will be developed to ensure mid-level accuracy.
Regular quality assurance checks will be performed to identify any issues or inaccuracies in the data.
